# NameGame

NameGame is a modern digital adaptation of a traditional pen-and-paper game with many regional variants. Players are given a random letter from the alphabet and must quickly come up with a **name**, **surname**, **animal**, and **town** that all begin with that letter. The game encourages creativity, memory, and fast thinking, and can be played solo or in groups.

## About the Game

What was once a handwritten, time-keeping challenge has been rebuilt into a mobile application for Android. A random letter is selected, and participants compete to complete all four categories as quickly and accurately as possible.

NameGame is available on the Google Play Store in Afrikaans as **Name-Vanne-Diere-Dorpe** and in English as **Name Game**:

## Development

This was my first large-scale software project, created before I completed my Computer Science degree. All development was done individually and entirely in **Java**, using **Android Studio** as the development environment.

The codebase reflects the learning-focused nature of the project: it does not follow proper architectural structure or clean-code methodologies. It is rudimentary, rough around the edges, and far from exemplary—but it taught me a significant amount about software development fundamentals, debugging, UI/UX, and project delivery.

## Current Status

Active support and development have been discontinued. Frequent Google Play and Android platform updates repeatedly introduced breaking changes, and maintaining compatibility became unsustainable for an independent developer. As a result, the application is no longer being updated or expanded.

The existing version remains available on the Play Store for reference and for anyone who still enjoys playing it.

## Building the Project

A compiled version is available for free on the Google Play Store. For those who wish to build it manually:

- Built using **Android Studio**
- Written in **Java**
- Uses standard Android SDK components
