# name-game
Name Game, an old traditional game with many different handles and variants. I recreated the one that I used to play growing up.

# The Game
The game used to be a pen-and-paper game that I have modernized into an Android game. A letter from the alphabet gets chosen at random and everyone participating has to come up with a name, surname, animal and town starting with the letter chosen.
The game is available on the Google Playstore under name-vanne-diere-dorpe(Afrikaans) or Name Game(English).

# The Code
The code was entirely written by me, Christo. It is my first large scale project that I started. The code is written in Java and follows no concise methodology or any good coding practices as it was more of a learning experience for me than anything else.

# Building The Repo
I keep the Google Playstore project as updated as possible with stable releases. Anybody can download the compiled version of the Application for free. If you insist on building it yourself, I used Android Studio to compile and deploy the app.
